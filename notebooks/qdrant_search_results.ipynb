      "['2 Gene Therapy\\nIf a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy\\nbe taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.\\nGene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a\\ngene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes\\nare inserted into a personâ€™s  cells and tissues to treat a disease.\\nCorrection of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into\\nthe individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate\\nfor the non-functional gene.\\nThe first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl\\nwith adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for\\nthe immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion\\nof the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency\\ncan be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated\\nby enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the\\npatient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that\\nthey are not completely curative.', ' Since the recombinant therapeutics\\nare identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted\\nimmunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was\\nobserved in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources.\\nHuman insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely\\nidentical to that of the natural molecule.\\nTransgenic animals are also used to understand how genes\\ncontribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for\\nhuman diseases, such as cancer , cystic fibr osis, r heumatoid arthritis\\nand Alzheimerâ€™s.\\nGene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individualâ€™s cells\\nand tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does\\nso by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or\\ngene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack\\ntheir hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as\\npart of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy\\ngenes or more recently portions of genes.\\nThe current interest in the manipulation of microbes, plants, and\\nanimals has raised serious ethical questions.', ' Techniques\\nof tissue culture and somatic hybridisation offer vast potential for\\nmanipulation of plants in vitro  to produce new varieties. Recombinant\\nDNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants\\nand animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically\\nModified Organisms have been created by using methods other than\\nnatural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to\\nanother , generally using techniques such as r ecombinant DNA\\ntechnology.\\nGM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post-\\nharvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are\\nseveral GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and\\nreduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).\\nRecombinant DNA technological processes have made immense\\nimpact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe\\nand more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics\\nare identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted\\nimmunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was\\nobserved in case of similar products isolated from ', 'some children ADA deficiency\\ncan be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated\\nby enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the\\npatient by injection.
